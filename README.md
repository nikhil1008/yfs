# MIT Distributed systems labs 6.824 - Spring 2012

This project is my implementation of the labs (1-5) from the distributed system class [6.824 - Spring 2012](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/6.824-2012/labs/index.html) at MIT (they make publicly available their course material). It is a one-semester project aiming at implementing a distributed file system in C++.
